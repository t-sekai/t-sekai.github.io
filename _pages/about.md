Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm an incoming M.S. student in Computer Sceince at Stanford University. Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) on robotics and reinforcement learning research and Dr. [Neil Smith](https://qi.ucsd.edu/about/leadership/neil-smith/) at [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu) on AI x XR applications. Iâ€™m broadly interested in embodied AI, generative AI, and virtual simulation.
